# Getting Started

Dear Team,

Despite having no prior experience with Flutter, I chose it for this project due to its relevance to Approachable Geek's technology stack. I wanted to demonstrate my adaptability and ability to learn quickly. While I acknowledge the rough edges in my code, I'm confident that given more time, I'll not only improve but also adapt to use Flutter's best practices. What's more, I found working with Flutter engaging and would enjoy the opportunity to further my skills.

I'd like to provide some context about the state of the repository you've received. While the commit history might suggest that the entire project was developed quickly on the due date, this isn't accurate. Initially, I set up a test program to grasp the basics of Flutter and, during this phase, ended up coding a significant portion of the project. As I was still exploring and practicing, I refrained from making commits, resulting in a messy and unorganized codebase.

In order to provide a clean, organized repository, I transferred the code to a new repo and reconstructed the commits. My aim was to replicate, as closely as possible, the actual order in which I developed the project and iterated on my work.

I attempted the bonus challenge of enabling profile photo editing. However, I encountered configuration issues with the image_picker library that I couldn't resolve despite extensive troubleshooting. I had to abandon this effort in the interest of time.

For the development and testing of this project, I utilized a Windows machine with WSL2 and tested the application on a Pixel 5 Android emulator (Android 31). I trust the application will run smoothly on MacOS, but if any issues arise, I would be more than happy to provide a demo using my local emulator.

Overall, I spent approximately 6-8 hours in development and a few additional hours learning about Flutter.

I appreciate the time you've taken to review my application and this project. I am excited about the prospect of working with Approachable Geek and look forward to the next stages of the application process.

Best Regards,

Justin Baker
